# Markdown is a markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. Markdown uses a fairly simple and straightforward syntax to markup text, making it easy to convert from plain text to HTML.
# In addition, Markdown is much shorter and easier to understand, you don't need to know HTML to use simple Markdown. So what are you waiting for, without following the summary of basic syntax to be fluent in using Markdown right now?
